# SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING

  The artifact that I chose for the Software Design and Engineering was my android app development class. In this class we were given a task to create an android app for the class that basically accepted data and validated it with a backend to ensure the data was valid then access was given. It was a login screen for my app which had a simple user interface which had some simple features like toggle button and a data entry bar and also a submit button. The basis for this app was a python code which I have attached to this portfolio repo.

  I chose this artifact as it best depicts the concept of software and UI design. This was a simple app but it made use of various tools and languages. I used the android studio app that gave be the ability to test my code on an android emulator to see what it would look, run and function like on an anctual android device. I also wrote some xml code that was the brains behind the design interface. The abdroid studio app had several functionalities but one i liked the most was the fuction of converting dign to code and vice versa. This helped me alot in my design phase as I was able to see the code in real time as i modified the interface on the design portal.

  As the class went on, I was asked to make some adjustment to the code which I did, basically it involved changes to the UI like adding new color and changing button layouts and all. It was a fun class as it gave me some more insight into design and visualization. It also gave me first hand exposure to an adroid device as I am very much so an ios person.
