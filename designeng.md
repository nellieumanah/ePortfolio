# SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING

  The artifact that I chose for the Database enhancement was the data from class with MongoDB. In this class we were given a task to create a python code that would enable us perform CRUD functions on a database.We took records regarding animals in a shelter and performed one of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update. Delete) functions on the data. This exposed me to the proper way to write python code (syntax and indentation) and also how to work with MongoDB.

  I chose this artifact as it best depicts the functionality of automating data into a database and also validating that the data entered was valid and consistent with the format required.This was a very great learning experience as I was able to make so many improvements to the code based on recoomedations from professionals who helped me with my code review to make subtle changes.

  The enhancements involved learning a lot of new thing and also gaining alot of insight into a level of automation required for real life scenarios. I also learned how to properly use python modules and how their syntax structure works.
