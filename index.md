# Welcome to Nellie Umanah's SNHU Capstone Project
This ePortfolio is a capstone project that  is required for the Southern New Hampsire University's Computer Science curriculum. Here, I demonstrated my  growth and knowledge in Software Design and Egineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Different links are provided to showcase the enchancement made on artifacts throughout the course of this project.

## **Educational Reflection**

Throughout my educational journey, I went from wanting to be a Biomedical Engineer to a Nurse then finally a Software Engineer. After settling with Computer Science, I transfered from Georgia State University to Southern New Hampshire University. The journey was difficult and exciting at the same time. I learned variety of new skills that has helped me during my acedmemic journey and that would also help me during my career, but also helped me through the challeges I had throughout all my courses work. Working through different courses, I learned programing, troubleshooting, and problem solving, which I believe are the foundation of the career of my choice. Moving forward, to my final semester at SNHU, I am able to demonstrate my skills as a programmer as I finish my last courses.

## **Self Assessment**

In the Capstone Project we was tasked to enhacne each an artifact of our choice that we have worked on in our pervious classes. I choose animal animal MongoDB project. This projects demonstrates my ability to authenticate and connect to a host. The enhancement I made further demonstrates my ability to enhance a code to be used not only for that particullay program, but others as well. It also gave me the ability to show my knowlegde with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Each enhancement was done over the course of a week. What I would do was take my program and alter it to make it more persentable based off my knowledge I have learned during my college career. One of the joys that I get is that I can look back on a program I wrote and know what needs to make it better even if it was the smallest thing. For example I added an identifier to my program which was just my name, contact infomation, and version. This will show who wrote the code, and how to get in contact with the developer. I believe that was important along with properly annotating my code, so that it can be easy to follow for others. That will also help others understand what each block of code is doing.

This ePortfolio showcased my ability as a programmer, by be able to read the requirements, tackle it, then implenment it. I hope that these enhancments demonstrates my skills that I developed over the course of these school years. I have learned alot of new techniques while I was pursing my Computer Science Degree and I plan on continuing to enhance those new skills all while on my new career path.
