# Welcome to Nellie Umanah's SNHU Capstone Project
This ePortfolio is a capstone project that  is required for the Southern New Hampsire University's Computer Science curriculum. Here, I demonstrated my  growth and knowledge in Software Design and Egineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Different links are provided to showcase the enchancement made on artifacts throught out the course of this project.

## **Educational Reflection**

Throught out my school career journey, I went from wanting to be a Biomedical Engineer to a Nurse then finally a Software Engineer. After settling with Computer Science, I transfered from Georgia State University to Souther New Hampshire. The journey was difficult and exciting at the same time. I learned variety of new skills that has helped me during my acedmemic journey and that would also help me during my career, but also helped me through the challeges I had throughout all my courses. Working through different courses I learned programing, troubleshooting, and problem solving. Which I believe are the foundation of the career of my choice. Moving forward, to my final semester at SNHU, I am able to demonstrate my skills as a programmer as I finish my last courses.
